This application automates the migration of database 'configurations' from an environment to another. 
This solves the issue of manually configuring say the production environment with configurations in the test environment. 
It allows for consistent updates that are less likely manually while providing the ability to pick and choose configurations to migrate.

The front end UI is built using Angular while the backend is a RESTful service built using Java SpringBoot, Spring JPA and H2 in memory database.
